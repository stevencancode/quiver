# Upgrade

Upgrade your wallet frequently because new features are added and bugs get fixed.

To upgrade, follow the [installation instructions](../../get-started/install-quiver.md) for your operating system.

The process does not affect the contents of your data directory, including the `wallet.dat` file. However, before you begin, [ensure you have a backup](backup-and-restore.md).
