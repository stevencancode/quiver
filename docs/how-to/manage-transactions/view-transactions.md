# View transactions

1. In Quiver, click the **Transactions** tab.
1. Find the transaction you want to view, select it, and either right-click or press the Control key and click it.
1. Select **View on block explorer**. The [default Arrow explorer](https://explorer.arrowchain.io/#/) opens in a browser window.

    !!! Tip "Use your favorite Arrow explorer"
        [Several Arrow explorers](../../reference/arrow-explorers.md) are available. Use the one you like the most. To view your transaction in a different Arrow explorer, copy the Tx ID displayed in the default explorer, paste it in the **Search** field in a different Arrow explorer, and run the search.
