# Send, view, and reply to memos

When you send ARW, you can optionally send an [encrypted memo](../../concepts/memos.md) to the recipient. Similarly, as a recipient of ARW, you can view memos that senders include as part of the transaction and reply to them, if they included a reply address.

## Send memos in transactions

1. On the **Send** tab, specify your recipient's address.
1. Click **Memo**. The Memo window is displayed.
1. Add the message in the **Memo** field. Memos are limited to 512 characters.

    !!! Tip
        To enable your recipient to reply to you, click **Include Reply Address**. Your address is added to the **Memo** field.

1. Click **OK**.

## View memos sent to you

1. On the **Transactions** tab, find the transaction with the memo, and hover the cursor over the speech bubble. The speech bubble is the icon for a memo.

Alternatively, select the transaction with the memo, and either right-click or press the Control key and click, and then select **View Memo**. The memo is displayed in a pop-up window.

## Reply to memos

If a reply address is in the memo you receive, you can reply to it. To reply, select the transaction with the memo, and either right-click or press the Control key and click, and then select **Reply to _address_**, where _address_ is the reply address given by the sender.
